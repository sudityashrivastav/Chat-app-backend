# Supabase in Replit

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an Open Source Firebase alternative. 

It's a SQL database you can connect to directly from the client.

Using Supabase you can:
- Read & Write data from a PostgreSQL database
- Listen to changes in Realtime
- Log users in to your app using Email/Google/Facebook etc.
- Store images and videos

## Demo Template

This repl shows how you can read from a pre-populated Countries table.

You can do advanced filtering, limit the number of results, and even do Full Text Search (e.g. only fetch countries that begin with the letter 'S')

You can use the demo keys provided in the example, or you can go to [https://app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io) to spin up your own database for free.
